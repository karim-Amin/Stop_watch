# Stop_watch
This project is implemented using Atmega16 Microcontroller based on software abstraction layer to separate the application from the external drivers and the internal drivers. I used six multiplexed 7-segments and three push buttons. The three push buttons to reset, stop and resume the stopwatch by using the external interrupts. The stopwatch is implemented using TIMER1 by compare mode.
